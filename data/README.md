# Data used in Graph-Toolformer Framework.

The data used in graph-toolformer include four part:

- Graph Raw Datasets: the raw datasets of different graphs studied in this framework
- Graph Reasoning Prompt Dataset: the designed prompts for various graph reasoning tasks
- Pre-trained Graph Model Checkpoints: pre-trained graph models for various graph reasoning tasks
- Fine-tuned Language Model Checkpoints: fine-tuned language models for different graph reasoning tasks

These data are introduced in detail and can be downloaded at the following pages, respectively.
