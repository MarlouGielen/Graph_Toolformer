# Data used in Graph-Toolformer Framework.

The data used in graph-toolformer include four parts:

- **1. Graph Raw Datasets**: the raw datasets of different graphs studied in this framework
- **2. Graph Reasoning Prompt Dataset**: the designed prompts for various graph reasoning tasks
- **3. Pre-trained Graph Model Checkpoints**: pre-trained graph models for various graph reasoning tasks
- **4. Fine-tuned Language Model Checkpoints**: fine-tuned language models for different graph reasoning tasks
