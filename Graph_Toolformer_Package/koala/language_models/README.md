More information about the language models used in this project can be found [at this page](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/Graph_Toolformer_Package#pre-trained-language-models)

The language checkpoint was fine-tuned with the graph reasoining prompt via the code in the [LLM_Tuning directory](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/Graph_Toolformer/tree/main/LLM_Tuning). The readers can also fine-tune the LLMs by yourself.
